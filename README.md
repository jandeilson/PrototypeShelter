PrototypeShelter is a script to save images of your prototypes online in an organized and simple way. To start using, just name your prototype, choose a category, define a version, and send the image of the prototype. Then a unique URL will be generated based on the name and version of the prototype and you can share this link whoever you wish.

## Settings

*It is necessary basic knowledge of PHP, MySQL database and server file management.*

Put the *prototypeshelter* folder of this repository on your server, edit the *config.php* file according to your personal settings and the MySQL database (use the *prototypeshelter_JDeS.SQL* file to import the default configuration of the Prototype Shelter script database).

Now go to *//yourdomain/prototypeshelter/dashboard.php* to start sending your prototypes.

Hope this script be new home of your image prototypes. :)
